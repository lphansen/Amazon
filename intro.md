## Abstract
Deforestation for cattle ranching in the Brazilian Amazon emits carbon,
and reforestation absorbs carbon. The social productivities for these alternative activities vary across locations. We analyze a spatial/dynamic model of
efficient land allocation to establish a benchmark for policies. We treat cattle
prices as stochastic and location-specific productivities as uncertain when assessing the consequences of imposing alternative prices of carbon emissions.
Modest price increases would incentivize Brazil to choose policies that capture
a significant amount of greenhouse gases in the next 30 years. Our analysis
pinpoints tropical forest management as an important contributor to climate
change mitigation.
